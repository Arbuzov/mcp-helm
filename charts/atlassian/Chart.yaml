# A chart can be either an "application" or a "library" chart.
#
# Application charts package versioned templates that can be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide utilities pulled in as dependencies.
# They cannot be deployed directly because no templates are defined.
type: application

# Bump this chart version whenever the chart or its templates change.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/).
version: 0.2.28

# This is the application version. Bump it whenever the app itself changes.
# It does not need to follow Semantic Versioning. Quotes are recommended.
