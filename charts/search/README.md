# Search Helm Chart

This chart deploys the MCP search crawler together with a companion FlareSolverr
instance. It packages both services in a single release so that they can share
configuration, lifecycle, and network policies when running on Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.22+
- Helm 3.9+

## Installation

Install the chart from the repository root:

```bash
helm install search ./charts/search
```

Override configuration values by providing a custom `values.yaml` file or by
setting flags during installation:

```bash
helm install search ./charts/search \
  --set crawler.image.repository=myrepo/crawler \
  --set flaresolverr.image.repository=myrepo/flaresolverr
```
